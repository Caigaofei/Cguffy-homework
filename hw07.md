**<font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program with machine language according to the following c.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int_8 a = 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int_8 c = a + 3;</font>**<br>
<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Write your assembly code & machine code.</font><br>
![](图片/1.(1).jpg "1.(1)")<br><br>
<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,fetch the instruction from the RAM.Then,convey the instruction to decode the instruction,and if data is needed,it will go back to the RAM to get the data.Finally execute the instruction.<br><br>
<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU.</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IR:暂时存储指令；<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PC:总是指向下一条指令，以从RAM中取出下一条指令；<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACC:将指令的处理结果不断累加起来。<br><br>
<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在机器中，变量 a 和 c 相当于一个 **可读可取** 的存储单元，是一个地址，里面可存储其他的信息如整数值等，访问变量的值即寻找变量的地址并读取地址的内容。<br><br><br><br>

<font size="4">1.What are stored in memory?</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<font size="3">Address and Data.</font>**<br><br>
<font size="4">2.Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<font size="3">No, they must be stored in different place ( address ).</font>**<br><br>
<font size="4">3.Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.</font><br>
**<font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction Format is the standard for us to write the instruction into the machine. It includes &nbsp;&nbsp;8-bit instruction specifier &nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;8-bit operand specifier. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instruction specifier 的形式就像这样：000xzzzz. 其中 x 表示的是寻址模式：1 表示操作数是数值； 2表示操作数是该地址的内容。 而 zzzz 的是操作码。<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operand specifier 的形式则像这样：bbbbbbbb。它表示的是一个数值或者是一个地址。<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. &nbsp;&nbsp;助记符：ADD #1 的机械语言表示为 &nbsp;&nbsp;00010000 00000001.</font>**<br><br><br><br>

<font size="4">1、汇编语言( Assembly Language )</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction, but assembler directives, macros and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the source code. <br>

<font size="4">2、编译（Compiler）</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis. <br>

<font size="4">3、命令式语言（Imperative programming）</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result. <br>

<font size="4">4、函数编程语言（Functional programming）</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.<br>

<font size="4">5、过程式编程（Procedural programming）</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack re
gister and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful (for example Lisp machines or Java processors). <br>
